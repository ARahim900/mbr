# Quick Setup Instructions - IMPORTANT!

## Your Clerk Authentication is Ready!

### 1. Create your .env.local file

After pulling this branch, create a `.env.local` file in your project root with these values:

```
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=YOUR_PUBLISHABLE_KEY_HERE
CLERK_SECRET_KEY=YOUR_SECRET_KEY_HERE
```

‚ö†Ô∏è **IMPORTANT**: Replace the placeholders above with your actual Clerk API keys from https://dashboard.clerk.com

### 2. Install dependencies

```bash
npm install @clerk/nextjs
```

### 3. Run your application

```bash
npm run dev
```

### 4. Test it!

- Visit http://localhost:3000
- Click "Sign Up" to create an account
- Your login will now persist across sessions!

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Security Note

- The `.env.local` file is already in `.gitignore` so it won't be committed
- Never share your CLERK_SECRET_KEY publicly
- These keys are for your development environment

## ‚úÖ What's Working Now

- Persistent authentication (no more repeated sign-ups!)
- Secure session management
- User profile management
- Protected routes

## üö® Delete this file after setup!

Once you've copied the API keys to your `.env.local` file, delete this SETUP_KEYS.md file for security.
