# Fix Clerk Authentication Issue

## Problem Summary
The old login page is showing because the Clerk environment variable is not configured. Your code is already set up to use Clerk, but it needs the API key to work.

## Quick Fix Steps

### 1. Create `.env.local` file
Create a new file called `.env.local` in your project root (same folder as package.json) with this content:

```
VITE_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=your_actual_clerk_key_here
```

### 2. Get your Clerk key
1. Go to https://clerk.com/dashboard
2. Sign in to your Clerk account
3. Select your application (or create one if you haven't)
4. Go to "API Keys" in the left sidebar
5. Copy the "Publishable Key" (starts with `pk_test_` for development)
6. Replace `your_actual_clerk_key_here` in the `.env.local` file with your actual key

### 3. Test locally
```bash
npm run dev
```
You should now see the Clerk login page with Google sign-in option.

### 4. Deploy to Netlify
1. Go to your Netlify dashboard: https://app.netlify.com
2. Select your site
3. Go to "Site settings" → "Environment variables"
4. Click "Add a variable"
5. Add:
   - Key: `VITE_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY`
   - Value: (paste your Clerk publishable key)
6. Save the variable

### 5. Trigger a new deployment
1. In Netlify, go to "Deploys"
2. Click "Trigger deploy" → "Clear cache and deploy site"

## Verification
After deployment, your live site should show the new Clerk authentication page with:
- Google sign-in button
- Email/password fields
- Modern UI matching your theme

## Troubleshooting
If you still see the old login page:
1. Hard refresh your browser (Ctrl+F5 or Cmd+Shift+R)
2. Clear browser cache
3. Try incognito/private mode
4. Check Netlify build logs for any errors

## Note
Never commit `.env.local` to git. It's already in `.gitignore` for security.
