# Husky Installation Fix - Netlify Deployment

## Issue
Build failed with error: `sh: 1: husky: not found` during npm install phase.

## Root Cause
The `prepare` script in package.json was trying to run `husky` but:
1. Husky wasn't installed as a dependency
2. Netlify runs with `NODE_ENV=production` which skips devDependencies
3. The prepare script runs automatically after npm install

## Solution Applied

### 1. Environment Variables (netlify.toml)
```toml
[build.environment]
  NETLIFY = "true"
  CI = "true"
  SKIP_HUSKY = "true"
```

### 2. Husky Bypass Script (.husky/install.mjs)
Created a script that checks for CI/production environment and skips husky installation.

### 3. Build Scripts
- Simplified build command to `vite build` only
- Created optional husky installation scripts
- Added fallback mechanisms to prevent failures

### 4. Optional Dependencies
Husky should be added as an optionalDependency in package.json:
```json
"optionalDependencies": {
  "husky": "^9.0.11"
}
```

## To Apply Fix Locally

Run one of these scripts:
```bash
# Option 1: Run the comprehensive fix
bash fix-netlify-complete.sh

# Option 2: Run the Node.js fix script
node scripts/fix-husky.js

# Option 3: Manual fix - update package.json prepare script
"prepare": "husky 2>/dev/null || true"
```

## Verification
After applying fixes, the deployment should:
1. Skip husky installation in production
2. Continue with the build process
3. Successfully build the Vite application

## Files Modified
- netlify.toml - Added environment variables
- .husky/install.mjs - Created bypass script
- scripts/fix-husky.js - Created fix script
- fix-netlify-complete.sh - Comprehensive fix script

## Status
âœ… Ready for redeployment - Husky will no longer block the build process.
